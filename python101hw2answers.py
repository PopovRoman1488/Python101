Complete the function mean for calculating the mean (average) of a 
list of numeric values.  Your function should take a  list vals as its

values.

Consider doing it with the in-line function sum, which facilitates a fast and readable one-line version of the function.

Complete the function sd for calculating the standard deviation of a

I suggest using float(len(vals)-1) for the denominator, but 
float(len(vals)) is fine.
