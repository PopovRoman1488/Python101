## Regular expressions

One of the most important aspects of programming for linguists is pattern matching. You will very often have to assess whether some string
matches some pattern, contains some sequence of characters, some number of characters, etc.

We’ve already seen that we can do this with what we’ve already learned. For example,
if we wanted to know if some string `s` contained the sequence 'ab', we could
simply write ’ab’ in `s` which would return `True` or `False`. If, on the other
hand, we wanted to know if a string contained ’a’ and then ’b’ with material
potentially intervening, we would have to do more. We might write a function like
this:

```python
#a and then b
def mymatch(s):
  i = 0
  #a flag to keep track of
  #whether we see an ’a’
  aFlag = False
  while i < len(s):
    if s[i] == ’a’:
      aFlag = True
      break
    i += 1
  #start looking for ’b’
  #where we left off
  while i < len(s):
    if s[i] == ’b’:
      #if we find ’b’, return
      #True of False depending
      #on whether we previously
      #saw ’a’
      return aFlag
    i += 1
  #if all that fails, return False
  return False

print(mymatch('Alice in ab Barcelona'))
```
We can test out how the function `mymatch()` applies to different strings. The logic of the function is that
we search the string for the first instance of ’a’ by iterating across the string with
the counter i. If we find it, we set the value of aFlag to True and exit the first
while loop. Then, without resetting i, we initiate another while loop to look
for ’b’. Not resetting the value of i means that the second loop picks up where
the first ended. Hence, the ’b’ must follow the (first) ’a’.

This is fine as it goes, but it doesn’t generalize. There are an infinite number of
patterns we might want to search for and writing a potentially complex matching
function for each one is at best tedious and at worst can lead to programming
errors.

Many programming languages, Python included, implement a general pattern
matching mechanism that is both flexible and efficient: *regular expressions*.

### Matching

Matching a string against some pattern is done with the `re` module and most
typically with the `search()` function in that module. At its very simplest, we can
invoke it like this:

```python
import re

if re.search(’ab’,'abba tour'):
  print(’a match’)
else:
  print(’no match’)
```

Here we import from `re` the pattern matching function `search()`. This function takes
two arguments: a pattern and a string. In this case, the pattern ’ab’ matches any
string that contains that letter sequence, e.g. ’abc’, ’xab’, ’ab’, ’xabc’.

We’ll consider the syntax of patterns in depth in the next section, but let’s consider
one slightly more complex pattern here: ’a.\*b’. This matches a string that
contains ’a’ followed anywhere by a ’b’. You can see this by playing with the
following program:

```python
import re

if re.search(’a.*b’,'Alice went to Barbados'):
  print(’a match’)
else:
  print(’no match’)
```

The `search()` function actually does not return `True` or `False`, but rather a
*match* object if the string matches or `None` if it does not. The reason why the code
in the two programs above works is that in an `if` statement, a match object will
evaluate to `True` and a `None` object will evaluate to `False`. The following code
shows this clearly.

```python
import re

#do two matches
res1 = re.search('a.*b','hat')
res2 = re.search(’a.*b’,’nab’)
#evaluate results of both matches
for s,r in [(’hat’,res1),(’nab’,res2)]:
    #simple if test
    if r:
        print(s,”matches ’a.*b’”)
        print(”r is a match object”)
    else:
        print(s,”does not match ’a.*b’”)
        print(”r is None”)
    #does the match simply false?
    if r == False:
        print(’r == False’)
    else:
        print(’r != False’)
    #is the match a None object?
    if r == None:
        print(’r == None’)
    else:
        print(’r != None’)
```
Here we explicitly save the output of `search()` and compare it against `False` and against None.

The interest of this distinction is that a match object does more for us than evaluate
to `True`. It is an object with several methods we can make use of: `group()`,
`start()`, `end()`, and `span()`.

The `group()` method simply returns the matched part of the string. In the case
of a pattern like ’a’, this will simply return ’a’ in the case of a match. In the
case of a more interesting pattern like ’a.\*b’, the `group()` method returns the
entire string from ’a’ to ’b’. The following code exemplifies:

```python
import re

#do a match
res = re.search('a.*b','abba')
#if the match succeeds...
if res:
    #print out what is matching
    print("match: ’",res.group(),"’",sep='')
else:
    print('no match')
```

If you try this with different command-line arguments, you’ll see that the `group()`
method returns the entire string from ’a’ to ’b’.

The `start()`, `end()`, and `span()` methods return the starting and ending
indices of the matched portion. The `span()` method returns both. The following
code exemplifies:

```python
import re

#do a match
res = re.search('a.*b','abba')
#if the match succeeds...
if res:
    #print out what is matching
    print("match: ’",res.group(),"’",sep='')
    print('starting index:',res.start())
    print('ending index:',res.end())
    print('both indices:',res.span())
else:
    print('no match')
```

Notice that, as with expressions with :, the ending index is the index of the character
after the final character of the pattern.

These methods allow us to see some other aspects of the code. First, the `match`
begins at the earliest possible point in the string. In the case at hand, if there are
multiple instances of ’a’, the `match` begins with the first one. Second, the `match`
is as greedy as possible. If there are multiple instances of ’b’, the match uses the
rightmost one.

Another useful general matching function is `findall()`. What this does is return
all instances of the match in a string. For example, if you match ’a’ against
’abracadabra’, this will return \['a','a','a','a','a'\]. The following
code exemplifies:

```python
import re

#find all matches
res = re.findall('a','hat')
#if it succeeds, if there is at least 1
if res:
    #print the list
    print('match:',res)
else:
    #print the empty list
    print('no match:',res)
```

Note that in the event of no match, `findall()` returns an empty list rather than
None.
