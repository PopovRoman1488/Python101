## Final Project Guidelines

### Requirements

1. Code (17 points):
A piece of code that addresses some (linguistic) problem. Your code should be roughly equivalent to one-two homework assignments.
It should be working and it should contain at least 3 independently defined functions.

2. Write-up (11 points):
The write-up could be done as a text part of the .ipynb file or as a text document separate from the file with your code.
It should not be very long, but it should: 1) state the goal of your project (1p.); 2) state why your project is interesting (2p.);
3) reformulate the problem in terms of functions that you plan to code (2p.); 4) describe what your program does and how it does it (2p.);
5) state what your code accomplishes (2p.); 6) state the program limitations and possible future improvements (2p.).

3. A 7 min. oral presentation (4 points) + 3 min. for questions: a clear and well-structured presentation of the write-up.
You get 1 point for clarity, 1 point for structure, 1 point for your ability to answer questions about your presentation
and 1 point for your questions about other people's work.


### Timeline
